# haskell-to-elm

Work-in-progress library for generating Elm type definitions, encoders, and
decoders from Haskell types. The goal is to be able to generate nice and
precise types on the Elm side.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Pretty-print the Elm AST
- [ ] Generate Elm modules
- [ ] Test that encoding and decoding round-trip with different Aeson settings
